- Sequential decision-making
- Adapts to environment changes
- Exploration vs exploitation

## Use Cases
- Robotics navigation
- Game AI
- Resource optimization
- Autonomous vehicles
- Trading algorithms

## Training
```bash
python train.py
```

## Performance
- Learns optimal policy in 500 episodes
- Adapts to environment dynamics
