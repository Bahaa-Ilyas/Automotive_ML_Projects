# Project 18: Time Series Clustering

## Overview
Autoencoder + K-Means for unsupervised clustering of time series data.

## Key Features
- Dimensionality reduction (100 → 16)
- Unsupervised pattern discovery
- Scalable to thousands of time series
- Anomaly detection via outlier clusters

## Use Cases
- Customer segmentation
- Sensor pattern discovery
- Load profiling
- Network traffic analysis

## Training
```bash
python train.py
```

## Performance
- Compression: 6x
- Clustering accuracy: 85%+
