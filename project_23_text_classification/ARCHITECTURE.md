# Architecture: Text Classification

## Pipeline
```
Text → TF-IDF Vectorization → Naive Bayes → Classification
```

## Components
- TF-IDF: Term frequency-inverse document frequency
- Naive Bayes: Probabilistic classifier
- 5 categories: Engine, Brakes, Electrical, Transmission, Other

## Next Steps
→ Project 24: Named Entity Recognition with spaCy
