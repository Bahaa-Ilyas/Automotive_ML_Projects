# Project 13: Network Anomaly Detection

## Overview
Autoencoder-based intrusion detection system for identifying network attacks and anomalous traffic patterns.

## Key Features
- Unsupervised learning (no labeled attacks needed)
- Detects unknown attack types
- Real-time network monitoring
- Low false positive rate

## Use Cases
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- DDoS attack detection
- Malware communication detection
- Network security monitoring

## Training
```bash
python train.py
```

## Performance
- Detection rate: 90%+
- False positive rate: <5%
- Inference: <1ms per packet
